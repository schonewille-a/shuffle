\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

\color{red} The purpose of the project Shuffle is provide an easy way to shuffle play music videos based on a specific keyword from Youtube. \color{black}

\subsection{Scope}

This project uses JavaScript utilizing Reactjs and various YouTube APIs.  The scope of our testing will cover mainly the correctness of our usage of the various YouTube APIs, any Javascript algorithms that define functionality and the UI made using React.  Reliability and robustness will be paid special attention to.  We will be doing both black-box and white-box testing.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
\color{red}This document will outline the testing process to be used to verify the web application 'Shuffle.'  The test will be categorized into two categories; System Tests, which will test the requirements of the system and Proof of concept tests, which will test the functionality of the system.  Every test will contain a description of how it will be carried out and by whom.\color{black}

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
Shuffle is a web app that generates personalized playlists based on the userâ€™s input and
preferences. It acts as a alternative to the major music streaming services.

\subsection{Test Team}
The following project members are responisble for all procedures of the validation process including writing and executing tests:
\begin{itemize}
\item Aidan Schonewille
\item Sullivan Stobo
\item Karlo Delalic
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
Shuffle will be tested using both automated and human testing. Program functions and the UI will be tested using an automated testing tool. The majority of the testing will be done using automated testing tools with an exception of testing the correctness of the video. The Test Team will compile a list of search terms, and it will check if the video is a good match (e.g. if it is a music video and not any other type such as an interview).

\subsection{Testing Tools}
Jest will be used to test the various React components and vanilla JS \color{red}for robustness and correctness to avoid any potential bugs or errors that we may have missed\color{black}. Manual testing will be used for the UI \color{red} as it is impossible to automatically conform that every UI element is in the correct location. Manual testing will also be used for visual confirmation\color{black} is required for correctness.

\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
Three tests will be made to compare Shuffle to the existing implementation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Test \color{red}\textbf{3.2.1, id2 }\color{black} will be used to test the usability and responsiveness of Shuffle and the existing implementation
\item Test \color{red}\textbf{3.2.2, id1 }\color{black} will be used to test the performance of Shuffle and the existing implementation
\item Test \color{red}\textbf{3.2.1, id1 }\color{black} will be used to test the overall satisfaction of Shuffle and the existing implementation 
\end{itemize}
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
Jest will be used for React component and vanilla JS testing, and manual testing will be used for UI testing.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
In order create unit tests for the internal functions of the program, certain methods that return values can be tested. This will involve taking the methods and giving them input values. Given what they are supposed to output and that they actually output a series of unit tests can be created. Unit tests will include unit tests that contain proper inputs and inputs that generate exceptions. Jest will be used for this purpose. Test cases will be created for each function and Jest will take care of the testing.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}	
In order to create test cases for the UI, the non-functional requirements will need to be taken into account. Examples of such are: the video to search term match, type of video returned, functionality of buttons, search bars, and other UI updating components. Manual testing will be used to test the UI as human verification of the video is required as not enough information is included in the video to distinguish from an incorrect match.
